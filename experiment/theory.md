### Introduction

In today's advancing field of neuroscience and artificial intelligence, network topology plays a fundamental role in determining how information is transmitted, processed, and learned. Network topology describes the structural arrangement of interconnected entities such as neural pathways in the brain, ecological food webs, or molecular interaction networks. Learning the network topology allows the researchers to analyse complex systems, optimize resource flow, and improve the resilience of biological, physical, and computational networks. In case of human brain, neurons form complex networks where their connections, or synapses, define the flow of electrical and chemical signals. Neural network topology, which defines the structural arrangement of neurons and their connections, directly influences information processing, learning efficiency, and overall system performance. The topology of these neural connections influences cognitive functions such as perception, memory, and decision-making. Similarly, in artificial neural networks (ANNs), the arrangement of layers and neurons dictates the efficiency of learning and pattern recognition. By studying network topology, scientists can better understand how neurons communicate, leading to advancements in neuroscience, brain-computer interfaces, and deep learning architectures. Understanding these connections also helps in optimizing computational models that mimic human intelligence, paving the way for more efficient AI systems.

As the complexity of networks increases, analysing and optimizing the structure becomes essential for maintaining efficient functionality. Graph-based algorithms, particularly shortest path algorithms, play a crucial role in evaluating network efficiency by identifying the most optimal routes between interconnected nodes. The algorithms, such as Dijkstra’s Algorithm, provide a systematic approach to minimizing travel time, reducing communication delays, and optimizing resource distribution in various networked systems, from neural pathways in the brain to large-scale transportation and telecommunication networks. Understanding Dijkstra’s Algorithm in the context of network topology equips students and professionals with the ability to model, analyse, and optimize real-world networks. Given the increasing reliance on intelligent systems, IoT (Internet of Things), and smart cities, mastering this algorithm is highly relevant in today’s technological landscape. By learning Dijkstra’s Algorithm and its applications in network topology, students can gain essential problem-solving skills that are crucial for tackling modern engineering and scientific challenges.

### Understanding Network Topology
Network topology refers to the arrangement of nodes (such as computers, routers, or devices) and connections (such as cables or wireless links) in a network. It defines how data flows between nodes and plays a crucial role in determining the efficiency, scalability, and reliability of a network.
Network topology is broadly categorized into physical topology, which describes the actual layout of devices and connections, and logical topology, which represents how data moves within the network, regardless of the physical layout. A well-structured network topology ensures optimal communication, minimizes latency, and enhances fault tolerance, making it essential for applications such as internet communication, electrical power distribution, and even biological neural networks.

### Types of Network Topology
Different types of network topologies (Fig.1) serve distinct purposes based on their structure and efficiency.

#### 1.Point to Point Topology: 
Point-to-point topology is a type of topology that works on the functionality of the sender and receiver. It is the simplest communication between two nodes, in which one is the sender, and the other one is the receiver. Point-to-Point provides high bandwidth.

#### 2.Bus Topology: 
All nodes share a single central communication line (bus). Data travels in both directions along the bus, but if the main cable fails, the entire network may be disrupted. This topology is cost-effective but has limited scalability.

#### 3.Star Topology: 
Every node is connected to a central hub or switch. The hub manages data transmission, ensuring efficient communication. It is highly reliable since individual node failures do not affect the entire network, but failure of the central hub can lead to network breakdown.

#### 4.Tree Topology: 
The nodes are arranged in a hierarchical structure, where each node is connected to a parent node, forming a branching tree-like pattern. Data flows between nodes through this structured hierarchy, ensuring efficient communication and organization. This topology is commonly used in large networks due to its scalability, as additional nodes can be easily added without disrupting the existing structure.

#### 5.Ring Topology: 
Nodes are connected in a circular manner, where data travels in one or both directions. While it provides equal data transmission opportunities to all nodes, a single point of failure can disrupt the entire network unless fault-tolerant mechanisms like dual rings are implemented.

#### 6.Mesh Topology: 
Every node is directly connected to multiple other nodes, ensuring high reliability and redundancy. It can be fully connected (where each node connects to every other node) or partially connected (where only some nodes have direct connections). While this topology enhances fault tolerance, it is costly due to the high number of connections required.

#### 7.Hybrid Topology: 
A combination of two or more topologies, offering flexibility and scalability. For example, a tree topology integrates multiple star networks into a hierarchical structure, making it ideal for large-scale enterprise networks.
