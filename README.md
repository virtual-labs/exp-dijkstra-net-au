### About the Experiment 

The experiment "Analyze Network Topology by Implementing Dijkstra’s Algorithm" introduces students to the fundamental principles of network routing and shortest path optimization. Using Dijkstra’s Algorithm, participants explore how data travels efficiently across networks by identifying the shortest path between nodes. This hands-on experiment enhances understanding of graph theory, network topology, and real-world applications in internet routing, traffic management, and communication systems. By implementing the algorithm in a controlled environment, learners gain practical insights into computational efficiency and decision-making in network design.
